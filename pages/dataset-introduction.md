# Dataset introduction

The [MrOS dataset](:files_path:/datasets) posted on the NSRR has gone through various post-processing steps in order to prepare the data for more widespread sharing. The dataset was based upon data prepared by the [San Francisco Coordinating Center](http://coordinatingcenter.ucsf.edu/research/studies.php). Changes and updates to the source data and variable definitions have been coordinated in the [mros-data-dictionary repository](https://github.com/sleepepi/mros-data-dictionary).
