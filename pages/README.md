# About the Study

MrOS is an ancillary study of the parent Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study. Between 2000 and 2002, 5,994 community-dwelling men 65 years or older were enrolled at 6 clinical centers in a baseline examination. Between December 2003 and March 2005, 3,135 of these participants were recruited to the Sleep Study when they underwent full unattended polysomnography and 3 to 5-day actigraphy studies. The objectives of the Sleep Study are to understand the relationship between sleep disorders and falls, fractures, mortality, and vascular disease.

The MrOS dataset on NSRR is limited in scope (e.g. no actigraphy raw data or results are included), with its primary focus being polysomnography (PSG) data. [MrOS Online](https://mrosdata.sfcc-cpmc.net/) is a publicly available resource that contains additional sleep variables and data from other MrOS research visits. For more information on the MrOS cohort, [contact the San Francisco Coordinating Center](http://coordinatingcenter.ucsf.edu/research/studies.php).

## EEG Spectral Analysis

As part of the NSRR's effort to explore the MrOS data in more detail, EEG spectral analysis was performed. Read more about the [methods, validation, and results for the NSRR EEG spectral analysis efforts](:pages_path:/eeg-spectral-analysis.md). There are [two summary datasets available](:files_path:/datasets/eeg-spectral-analysis) and the [included variables can be browsed here](https://www.sleepdata.org/datasets/mros/variables?folder=Spectral+Analysis).

## HRV Analysis

As part of Ancillary Study #108, researchers at Case Western Reserve University performed heart rate variability analysis on MrOS Sleep Visit 1 data.
