# About the Study

MrOS is an ancillary study of the parent Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study. Between 2000 and 2002, 5,994 community-dwelling men 65 years or older were enrolled at 6 clinical centers in a baseline examination. Between December 2003 and March 2005, 3,135 of these participants were recruited to the Sleep Study when they underwent full unattended polysomnography and 3 to 5-day actigraphy studies. The objectives of the Sleep Study are to understand the relationship between sleep disorders and falls, fractures, mortality, and vascular disease.
